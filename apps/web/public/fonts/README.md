# Font Files Required

To match the recify.app design exactly, you need to add the following premium font files to this directory:

## PP Pangram Sans Compact
- `PPPangramSansCompact-Bold.woff2`
- `PPPangramSansCompact-Semibold.woff2`
- `PPPangramSansCompact-Medium.woff2`

## PP Object Sans
- `PPObjectSans-Bold.woff2`

## How to obtain these fonts

These are premium fonts from Pangram Pangram Foundry. You can purchase them from:
- https://pangrampangram.com/products/pangram-sans
- https://pangrampangram.com/products/object-sans

Alternatively, you can use similar free alternatives:
- For PP Pangram Sans Compact: Work Sans, Outfit, or Manrope
- For PP Object Sans: DM Sans or Public Sans

## Fallback

The app will fall back to Inter font if these files are not present.
